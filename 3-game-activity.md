# Game Piece Activity

1. Open up [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/){:target="_blank"}, create an account or log-in. Open a new design. 
2. Make the base of the piece:
  - Grab a cone from the basic shapes panel on the right and drag it on to the workplane. 
  - Stretch the cone so that it is 30mm for all three dimensions by dragging the white handles on the base and top of the cone (or by clicking on the handles and entering “**30**” in the fields).

  - Drag a sphere (or another interesting shape) to the workplane:
  - Shrink the shape down so the base and height measurements are all 11mm. 
  - Raise the sphere 25mm from the workplane, by grabbing the black hat on top of the cone upwards.
  - “**Align**” all shapes on workplane & then “**Group**” all pieces together.
